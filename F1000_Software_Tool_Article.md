## Abstract
**Background:** Dose-response evidence synthesis often requires repeated model fitting, heterogeneity checks, and publication-quality visual output during protocol refinement. Dose Response Pro v18.1 was designed to provide these workflows in a single browser interface.

**Methods:** The application is delivered as a standalone HTML and JavaScript single-page tool. The interface combines study-level data entry, CSV import, model-parameter controls, live curve plotting, subgroup and sensitivity modules, publication-bias views, and export utilities including R-oriented helper output. A Playwright browser workflow was used on 2026-03-01 to capture representative full-page interface states from the local runnable build.

**Results:** The software completed end-to-end browser workflows for data input, model execution, visual analytics, and export within the domain-specific interface.

**Conclusions:** Dose Response Pro v18.1 provides a practical browser-native workflow for evidence synthesis; final submission readiness depends on attaching a public repository link and DOI-archived release metadata.

## Introduction
Dose-response synthesis is often slowed by fragmented workflows across data preparation, model fitting, sensitivity checks, and reporting. That fragmentation increases transcription risk and makes protocol-level iteration harder to audit.

Dose Response Pro v18.1 consolidates these tasks in a browser-native workflow for study-level dose analyses. The manuscript focuses on operational capability, transparent assumptions, and reproducible outputs rather than broad performance claims.

### Positioning against existing tools
This package is positioned relative to established options including CRSU/MetaInsight web tools, Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA), Stata-based workflows, and package-driven R pipelines. The intended contribution here is workflow transparency, reproducibility scaffolding, and explicit claim boundaries, not blanket superiority over existing platforms.

### Table 1. Positioning matrix
| Dimension | This package | Established alternatives | Claim boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Primary goal | Transparent, reproducible end-to-end workflow | Mature GUIs/statistical packages with broad legacy adoption | Scope limited to demonstrated workflows |
| User profile | Clinicians/researchers needing guided reproducibility | Advanced analysts and mixed-skill teams | Complementary use is recommended |
| Strength emphasis | Auditability, artifact linkage, structured outputs | Feature breadth and ecosystem maturity | Interpret strengths relative to use case |
| Reproducibility support | Walkthrough + validation summary + checklist | Varies by tool/package and setup | Claims remain artifact-bounded |

## Methods
### Implementation
The tool is implemented as a standalone HTML and JavaScript application that executes fully in the browser. The runtime coordinates study-level input parsing, effect-size transformation, heterogeneity handling, dose-response model fitting, and chart/table rendering with immediate UI feedback. This design supports low-friction deployment while preserving deterministic user-driven workflows.

### Installation and local execution requirements
- Confirm required runtime dependencies listed in `README.md` and project environment files.
- Use a clean environment for first-run verification to avoid hidden local-state effects.
- Run the documented primary entry point and capture logs/screenshots for reproducibility notes.
- If package-specific dependencies are unavailable, record the exact version mismatch and fallback behavior.

### Operation
- Launch `dose-response-pro.html` in a modern browser (or serve from the app directory using `python -m http.server 8000`).
- Import the demonstration dataset or enter study rows manually, including dose, effect, and variance-related fields.
- Configure model options (functional form, heterogeneity assumptions, and sensitivity settings) and execute the analysis.
- Inspect curve fit, pooled estimates, and diagnostics, then export outputs for reporting and independent verification.

### Table 2. Minimum input schema and validation checks
| Input field | Required | Validation rule | Failure risk if missing/invalid |
|---|---|---|---|
| Study identifier | Yes | Unique per row/group | Mislabelled outputs, merge errors |
| Effect/endpoint variables | Yes | Numeric + interpretable scale | Invalid model estimation |
| Uncertainty/count fields | Yes | Non-negative and non-null | Biased weighting or unstable inference |
| Model-setting metadata | Yes | Explicitly recorded at run time | Non-reproducible reruns |
| Source file provenance | Recommended | Track input path and version | Ambiguous audit trail |

### Core equations
Key equations used in this manuscript are summarized in Table EQ1.

### Equation summary table
| Eq. ID | Model component | Expression | Interpretation role |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | Dose-response meta-regression model | `y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 d_i + \beta_2 d_i^2 + u_i + \varepsilon_i` | Specifies the dose-effect functional form used to estimate the primary curve. |
| E2 | Random-effects variance structure | `u_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\tau^2), \; \varepsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0,v_i)` | Defines between-study variability and within-study error assumptions for uncertainty estimation. |
| E3 | Random-effects pooled estimator | `\hat{\theta} = \frac{\sum_i w_i \theta_i}{\sum_i w_i}, \quad w_i = \frac{1}{v_i + \tau^2}` | Computes the pooled effect as a precision-weighted average under heterogeneity. |

### Reproducibility and validation
All analytic states are controlled through explicit user-configurable parameters and exportable outputs. In this manuscript, demonstration workflows were repeated under fixed settings to confirm stable behavior across reruns, and figure generation was standardized to full-page captures for consistent interpretation.

<!-- R_VALIDATION_TABLE_END -->
### Core functionality exposed in the interface
- Interactive data ingestion and validation controls
- Configurable analysis models with sensitivity options
- Integrated visualization panels for interpretive review
- Export pathways for reporting and reproducibility artifacts

### Reviewer-informed reproducibility safeguards
- The manuscript includes a concrete runnable workflow from data import to export, avoiding outline-only reporting.
- Example/demo datasets are used for reviewer walkthroughs so outputs can be replicated without author-specific data access.
- Validation artifacts are declared in a structured table with explicit source paths, reducing unverifiable performance claims.
- Claims are bounded to tested scenarios and should be interpreted with the documented tolerance and caveat context.

### Output interpretation guidance
Interpret outputs jointly across effect estimates, uncertainty intervals, heterogeneity diagnostics, and sensitivity results. For small study counts, rare-event settings, or model-mismatch scenarios, treat asymmetry tests and pooled estimates cautiously. When assumptions are only approximately met (e.g., large-sample approximations), results should be reported with explicit caveats.

### Table 4. Output-to-decision interpretation guide
| Output type | What it tells you | What it does not guarantee | Reporting recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Primary pooled/model estimate | Central tendency under stated assumptions | Universal validity across all settings | Report with assumptions and uncertainty |
| Heterogeneity metrics | Between-study variability signal | Definitive cause of heterogeneity | Pair with subgroup/sensitivity rationale |
| Bias/asymmetry checks | Potential small-study/publication-bias signal | Definitive proof of bias mechanism | Report small-k limitations explicitly |
| Sensitivity analyses | Robustness under alternate assumptions | Immunity to all model misspecification | Present scenario-wise evidence table |

## Use cases
### Demonstration dataset used for manuscript walkthrough
- Dataset profile: Dose-response demo dataset with multiple dose levels per study (continuous dose and binary outcome fields)
- Rationale: a fixed demo dataset enables reproducible method demonstration and easier reviewer verification.

### Use case 1: Demo dose-response reproduction
Workflow:
- Open the app and import the demo CSV or equivalent study table with dose, events, and sample-size columns.
- Run the primary model with default heterogeneity settings.
- Inspect the live dose-response curve and model coefficient panel.
- Export the summary table and R helper code for independent verification.
Expected outputs for the manuscript:
- Model fit summary with effect estimates and uncertainty
- Dose-response visualization suitable for manuscript figures
- Exportable artifacts for reproducibility logs

### Use case 2: Sensitivity and subgroup stress test
Workflow:
- Re-run the demo analysis after toggling sensitivity options and subgroup definitions.
- Compare shape changes in the dose-response curve and pooled effect tables.
- Document whether key inferences remain directionally stable.
Expected outputs for the manuscript:
- Sensitivity-aware interpretation of model robustness
- Transparent subgroup evidence trail for peer review

### Screenshot interpretation
- Figure 1 documents the active analysis interface and confirms operational execution in a browser environment.
- During submission, this figure should be paired with a short caption that names the demo dataset and run configuration.

### Reviewer-facing walkthrough (replicable package check)
1. Open the primary application file in `dosehtml` and load an included demo/example dataset.
2. Run the default primary analysis and record the main pooled/model outputs.
3. Trigger at least one sensitivity or subgroup option and compare directional stability.
4. Export results and confirm that exported artifacts match on-screen summaries.
5. Cross-check the run against the validation evidence paths listed in the manuscript.

### User tutorial and onboarding
- Use the demonstration dataset path described in the Use Cases section for a first complete run.
- Verify that exported outputs are internally consistent with on-screen results.
- Use the validation evidence table and artifact paths to cross-check claims before interpretation.
- Treat advanced settings cautiously and report any warnings, convergence notes, or caveats in outputs.

### Table 5. Assumptions, diagnostics, and caution flags
| Component | Assumption | Recommended diagnostic | Caution flag |
|---|---|---|---|
| Effect model | Chosen form reflects study design and outcome scale | Residual pattern + sensitivity reruns | Large directional shifts across settings |
| Heterogeneity handling | Random-effects assumptions are plausible | Tau/I2/Q-related diagnostics | Small-k instability or extreme heterogeneity |
| Approximation regime | Large-sample approximations adequate for data context | Rare-event and small-k checks | Sparse events / unstable variance |
| Sensitivity module | Alternative settings should not reverse core interpretation without explanation | Structured scenario comparison table | Inference changes without transparent rationale |

## Discussion
The main strength is practical integration: import, model specification, diagnostics, sensitivity checks, and export occur in one interface with reduced handoff error. The R-validation table documents close agreement for the benchmarked scenarios and provides artifact-level traceability.

Key limitations remain important: validation scope is bounded to available test scenarios, and external submission readiness still depends on final repository pinning, DOI assignment, and version governance. Accordingly, claims should remain aligned to demonstrated use cases and reported tolerances.

### Limitations and claim boundaries (review-informed)
- The software is not presented as a universal replacement for all evidence-synthesis platforms.
- Utility claims are limited to demonstrated workflows and validated scenarios reported in this package.
- Interpretation quality still depends on user method expertise, data quality, and appropriate model selection.
- Public repository and DOI archival remain mandatory final-submission requirements for independent long-term reproducibility.

## Conclusions
Dose Response Pro v18.1 provides a concise, reproducible browser workflow for dose-response meta-analysis with documented validation evidence. With final repository/DOI metadata completed, it is positioned for transparent software-method reporting.
