Dose Response Pro: Browser-Based Dose-Response Meta-Analysis Matching R Accuracy

Can browser-based dose-response meta-analysis match the numerical accuracy of established R packages while providing interactive visualization? Dose Response Pro v18.1 is a 10,022-line single-file HTML application implementing the Greenland-Longnecker two-stage method for dose-response meta-analysis with linear, quadratic, and restricted cubic spline models, plus leave-one-out sensitivity analysis. The tool provides interactive dose-response curve plotting, CSV import with flexible column detection, R code export for reproducibility checks, and a command-line interface for batch processing alongside the browser application. Strict benchmarking against the R dosresmeta package showed exact parity on 120 of 120 comparable datasets with a median runtime speedup of 1.92x over the R implementation. Deterministic CLI validation confirmed three-of-three passed checks including grid-based coefficient verification against independently computed reference values. This demonstrates that client-side JavaScript can deliver publication-quality dose-response synthesis with performance exceeding dedicated statistical environments. However, the limitation of exploratory spline model status means complex non-linear relationships require independent validation before clinical interpretation of inflection points.
